# NickName Generator

In this practice session, I have created a project to create Nickname

## Key Concept
The project reads csv file into a DataTable. All the active Club Member details are stored in a DataRow array.
For each row we then read both first name and last name and use string operations to generate a nick name.

## Getting Started
Download the file or clone in to your local machine and open it through the UiPath Community edition.
No additional packages required.

## Problem Statement
The project reads csv file into a DataTable. All the active Club Member details are stored in a DataRow array. For each row we then read both first name and last name to generate a nick name.
